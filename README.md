# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
ETL and meta-analysis of Amazon Vine reviews with AWS, postgresql, PySpark, and Google Colab

## Overview
The overarching purpose of this project was to conduct a meta-analysis of Amazon reviews. Specifically it was to analyze reviews produced as part of the Amazon Vine program, where select members of Amazon's reviewer community are compensated to review sample products. The primary goal of this inquiry is to determine if there is any bias towards favorable reviews from the paid Vine members in the available data.

Out of the 50 datasets of product categories available to chose from, I chose to analyze reviews in the Camera category - high-value, technical products requiring experience and knowledge to effectively review. The initial ETL portion of the project was conducted, as proscribed, using AWS, postgresql, and PySpark in Google Colab. The data analysis segment was conducted using PySpark and Google Colab.
